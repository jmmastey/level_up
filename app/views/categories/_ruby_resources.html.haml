%p.resource CodeSchool has some of the best beginner tutorials on <a href='https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby'>Ruby, Rails and Rspec</a> around.
%p.resource Once you've done the RubyBits tutorial on CodeSchool, practice writing some basic code and learn more syntax with the <a href='http://koans.heroku.com/en'>Ruby Koans</a>.
%p.resource This <a href='http://lostechies.com/chrismissal/2009/05/27/anti-patterns-and-worst-practices-the-arrowhead-anti-pattern/'>article</a> summarizes Arrowhead programming, even if it's in Java. You can laugh at the Java-isms.
%p.resource This <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3802540/difference-between-class-variables-and-class-instance-variables'>StackOverflow article</a> summarizes the differences between class variables and class instance variables. This difference often confuses new Rubyists.
%p.resource After that, get some practice writing small programs (and get some feedback) with <a href='http://exercism.io/'>Exercism</a>
%p.resource This Thoughtbot <a href='https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style#ruby'>style guide</a> isn't as focused, but it is pretty fantastic. See also the canonical <a href='https://github.com/styleguide/ruby'>Ruby</a> and <a href='https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide'>Rails</a> style guides.
%p.resource If you want to automate checking for style guide violations, check out the <a href='https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop'>Rubocop</a> gem. The exercise repo has a config for it already.
